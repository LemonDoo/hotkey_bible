It’s the Third Day. 
I can’t take this any longer. 
Roblox has been down for 72 hours and my body cannot handle this copious amount of mental stress. 
I’ve had numerous seizures from the lack of entertainment and content from Roblox. 
During the 72 hours I had found myself breathless and unable to speak. 
No matter how long I sleep I can’t find the energy to even leave my bed. 
This is hell. 
It seems that I won’t be able to find salvation anytime soon… 
I hope that soon enough the Heavens will grace me with Roblox once again 
and that I can soon see my precious Meeps and Adopt Me pets. 
I am sure they are starving right now. 
I can already foresee my fate. 
I shall collapse under heart failure as I see my PC screen flash: 
“We are no longer working on Roblox. Take care. -ROBLOX”. 
The sheer weight of that message had doomed me into falling into the endless abyss of boredom. 
I cannot see the light at the end of the tunnel… 
I fear that this may never come to an end. 
I feel as though that if I don’t play roblox I would be writhing for the next 10 hours in horrible agony. 
I may unconsciously harm myself or others if I don’t receive any entertainment from Roblox right this instant. 
It’s now 10 minutes later, I am having frequent blackouts and my sanity is deteriorating. 
I asked my parents to isolate me in my room so I don’t cause harm to them in any way. 
I have also already destroyed my bed. As I cry myself to sleep for the twelfth time since the shutdown, 
I lay in my annihilated room, my distraught parents seeking help from others, 
oblivious to the fact only Roblox could fix me now….
